The notebooks must be run in the order listed below.

1. 200921_PM2_Collection: A notebook for data collection from Naver News. But it will take more than just a few hours to run this notebook, and the results may be different because articles about this topic are still being updated.


2. 200921_PM2_Exploration: A notebook for exploring the basic characteristics of the data.

3. 201005_PM4_Cleaning: A notebook for cleaning the data.

4. 201017_Final: The notebook that does the topic modeling and generates relevant barplots.



Notebooks that were not used in the final paper:

- 201001_PM3_Analysis: A notebook used for exploring topic modeling as a possible way of data analysis. The data had not been cleaned at this point, and thus the results were not as accurate.

- 201005_PM4_Analysis: A notebook used to perform topic modeling with the cleaned data, but this was not used in the final version due to issues with Korean language processing and errors in topic modeling.
